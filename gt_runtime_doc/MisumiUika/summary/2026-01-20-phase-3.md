# Phase 3 Summary

- Dashboard status uses daemon state and BeadsReader-backed lists.
- Convoy fetcher reads town issues.jsonl (dependencies parsed) with BEADS_DIR-scoped CLI fallback.
- Workflow ready list uses JSONL dependency scan; mayor hook status reads hooked beads from town beads.
- BeadsReader now parses dependencies and scopes bd fallback via BEADS_DIR; ReadyBeads added.
