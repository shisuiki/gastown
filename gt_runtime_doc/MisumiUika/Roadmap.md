# Roadmap

## Phase 0: Bootstrap runtime docs
- Create required files and folder layout under `gt_runtime_doc/MisumiUika/`.
- Commit the initial runtime docs.

## Phase 1: Understand current role templates
- Review role templates in `internal/templates/roles/`.
- Identify where to inject runtime docs workflow instructions.

## Phase 2: Implement runtime docs workflow
- Add AI-friendly instructions for runtime docs (Memory/Roadmap/Progress/summary).
- Ensure crew and mayor emphasize long-term memory, progress updates, and summaries.
- Add consistent guidance for other roles as needed.

## Phase 3: Validate and land
- Run relevant tests (templates or minimal Go tests if available).
- Update Progress and write summary when phases complete.
- Commit and push changes.
