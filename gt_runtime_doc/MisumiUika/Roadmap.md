# Roadmap

## Phase 0: UX review scope and inventory
- Read WebUI templates, handlers, and nav structure to map pages/flows.
- Identify redundant/low-signal elements and long-list risks with large rigs/agents.

## Phase 1: Cross-site IA recommendations
- Propose page/tab additions/removals and global navigation changes.
- Define content hierarchy principles (summary vs detail, progressive disclosure).

## Phase 2: Page-by-page recommendations
- For each page, assess elements, data density, and interaction affordances.
- Propose concrete changes (remove/merge/split components, new controls).

## Phase 3: Deliver UX optimization doc
- Produce a structured document with priorities and rationale.
