# Roadmap

## Phase 0: UX review scope and inventory
- [x] Read WebUI templates, handlers, and nav structure to map pages/flows.

## Phase 1: Cross-site IA recommendations
- [x] Propose page/tab additions/removals and global navigation changes.
- [x] Define content hierarchy principles (summary vs detail, progressive disclosure).

## Phase 2: Page-by-page recommendations
- [x] For each page, assess elements, data density, and interaction affordances.
- [x] Propose concrete changes (remove/merge/split components, new controls).

## Phase 3: Deliver UX optimization doc
