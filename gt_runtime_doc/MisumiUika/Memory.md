# Memory

- Role: TerraNomadicCity crew (MisumiUika).
- This repo: Gas Town.
- Runtime docs live under `gt_runtime_doc/<name>/` only; do not read or modify others.
- Keep Memory under 200 lines; store high-level context, not deep technical details.
- For large tasks: update Roadmap, clear Progress, update Progress per task, write summaries per phase/task completion.
- Completed: runtime docs protocol added to role templates; templates validated with `go test ./internal/templates`.
