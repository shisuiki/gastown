# Memory

- Role: TerraNomadicCity crew (MisumiUika).
- This repo: Gas Town.
- Runtime docs live under `gt_runtime_doc/<name>/` only; do not read or modify others.
- Keep Memory under 200 lines; store high-level context, not deep technical details.
- For large tasks: update Roadmap, clear Progress, update Progress per task, write summaries per phase/task completion.
- Current mission: update role prompts to enforce runtime docs workflow for all roles; create/update templates accordingly.
