# Prompt Docs Phase 1

Updated crew and mayor long prompts to make the Runtime Docs system explicit and operational.
The new text explains what Memory, Roadmap, Progress, summary/ and Log.md are for,
how to update them, and emphasizes autonomy (no human dependency). It also removed
the “mail the human” guidance and replaced idle states with autonomous next actions.
Log.md is now defined as append-only with timestamped entries using `>>`.
