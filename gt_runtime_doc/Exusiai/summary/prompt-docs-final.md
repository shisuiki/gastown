# Prompt Docs Final Summary

Crew and Mayor prompts (long + short) now reinforce the Runtime Docs system with
explicit roles for Memory, Roadmap, Progress, summary/, and Log.md, and remove
human-dependency guidance. The prompts instruct agents to update Memory immediately,
plan via Roadmap, track Progress with notes, write detailed phase summaries, and
append timestamped Log.md entries without reading the file.
