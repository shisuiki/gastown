# Progress

- Added prompt partials and reordered role templates with critical rules and Do-Not-Do sections.
- Added AgentName to role data and updated crew/polecat templates for naming clarity.
- Aligned system prompts with role boundaries.
- Added --confirm guardrails to high-risk gt commands (down, shutdown, uninstall, rig remove/reset, polecat nuke, unsling, release).
- Ran `go test ./internal/templates`.
