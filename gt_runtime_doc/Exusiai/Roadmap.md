# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Source review and role/prompt analysis
- Gather core docs (README, docs/overview, templates/system-prompts, templates/roles).
- Identify role taxonomy, responsibilities, and prompt design patterns.

## Phase 2: CLI inventory and risk analysis
- Enumerate gt/bd commands and subcommands via `--help` and source references.
- Classify commands by safety, complexity, and likelihood of misuse.

## Phase 3: Report synthesis
- Produce detailed report in docs/ with findings, risks, and recommendations.
- Include command catalog, improvement proposals, and top-priority issues.

## Acceptance criteria
- Report covers structure, prompts, and design trade-offs.
- gt/bd command lists include second-level subcommands at minimum.
- Clear list of high-risk/problem areas and actionable fixes.
