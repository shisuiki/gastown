# Progress

- Cleared for backlog dispatch workflow fix (hq-37635).
- Added `gt deacon backlog-dispatch` to pair ready issues with idle polecats.
- Inserted backlog dispatch step into `mol-deacon-patrol` (version bump to 9).
- Tests: `go test ./internal/cmd/...` fails (existing bd type validation in done_test).
