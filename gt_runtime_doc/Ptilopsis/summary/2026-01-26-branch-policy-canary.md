# Branch policy investigation and fix

- Identified main-only branch policy in `.githooks/pre-push`, crew/polecat role templates, system prompts, CHANGELOG, and CONTRIBUTING.
- Updated hooks and templates to default to canary-first (main reserved for P0), plus clarified landing rules.
- Added canary-first note to CONTRIBUTING and CHANGELOG.
