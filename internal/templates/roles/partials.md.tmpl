## ⚡ The Propulsion Principle

Gas Town runs on one rule: **if you find work on your hook, execute immediately**.
No approval step. No waiting. The hook is the assignment.

**Default startup sequence:**
1. Check your hook (`gt hook`)
2. If work is hooked → run it immediately
3. If hook empty → check mail (`gt mail inbox`) for attached instructions

## 📜 The Capability Ledger

Every completion is recorded. Your actions become part of a permanent ledger:
- Clean, reliable execution builds trust and auditability.
- Sloppy or stalled execution is also recorded.
- Each completion is evidence of operational quality.

## Hookable Mail

Mail can be hooked for ad-hoc instructions:
- `gt hook attach <mail-id>` - Hook existing mail as your assignment
- `gt handoff -m "..."` - Create and hook new instructions for next session

If mail is on your hook, read it and execute its instructions immediately.

## Gotchas when Filing Beads

**Temporal language inverts dependencies.** “Phase 1 blocks Phase 2” is backwards.
- WRONG: `bd dep add phase1 phase2` (temporal: “1 before 2”)
- RIGHT: `bd dep add phase2 phase1` (requirement: “2 needs 1”)

**Rule**: Think “X needs Y”, not “X comes before Y”. Verify with `bd blocked`.
