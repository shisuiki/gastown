# Archived Docs (January 2026)

The following documents were moved here to declutter the active docs surface:

- `FAILURE_MODES_REPORT.md` – historical failure investigation report and root-cause analysis.
- `gastown-research-report.md` – crew research output, no longer part of the core docs.
- `gastown-webui-report.md` – historical WebUI research notes.
- `DOG-TIMEOUT-FIX-REPORT.md` – mayor-generated report about dog timeouts in Canary infrastructure.

Each archived file now resides in this folder, and the original paths retain small stubs that point back here.

## Scope
- Scope description pending.
